      "The cover art for \"Celestial Confluence\" depicts a breathtaking scene that captures the essence of the story. In the foreground, the Intrepid Explorer, a sleek and advanced starship, is suspended in the vastness of space. Its gleaming hull and illuminated windows convey the spirit of human innovation and progress. Above the starship, a swirling vortex of colors and lights represents the Ephemeral Expanse, the mysterious region of space that is central to the novel. The dynamic play of light and shadow emanating from the Expanse adds depth and intrigue to the scene, hinting at the novel's central themes of exploration and the unknown. Dominating the background, a colossal and enigmatic structure emerges from the depths of the Ephemeral Expanse. The structure, an embodiment of the alien intelligence Xanthera, is a stunning fusion of organic and inorganic elements. Its intricate, fractal-like patterns and undulating contours hint at the complexity of the intelligence that resides within. In the distance, faint silhouettes of various celestial bodies and alien ships suggest the vast, interconnected community of interstellar beings that populate the cosmos. These subtle details evoke a sense of unity and diversity, highlighting the story's exploration of humanity's role in the greater cosmic tapestry."
